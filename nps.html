        By evening, these winds may intensify to 95-105 kmph, gusting up to 115 kmph in the same area. Adjoining areas of the west-central and south Arabian Sea, and the coasts of north Kerala, Karnataka, and Goa are therefore likely to be most impacted by the storm.According to a study ‘Changing status of tropical cyclones over the north Indian Ocean', the Arabian Sea saw a significant increasing trend in the intensity, frequency, and duration of cyclonic storms and very severe cyclonic storms during the 1982–2019 period."The increase in cyclone activity in the Arabian Sea is tightly linked to the rising ocean temperatures and increased availability of moisture under global warming. The Arabian Sea used to be cool, but now it is a warm pool,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, Climate Scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and Lead IPCC Author.The IMD had on Tuesday said the cyclone is likely to influence the monsoon progress.
